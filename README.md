PONG is an interactive game in Javascript, a clasic two player game that triggers two balls when the player number 1 scores 2 points. 
The score for each player is displayed at the top of the board and everytime the ball bounces audio is triggered using HTML5 audio sounds.
SVGs (vector) graphics were dynamically generated using ES2015 classes.
OOP (object oriented programming) approach, was implemented to write the code in Javascript making use of class construction making the code more readable.

During the making of this game I learned how to make SVGs from scratch, I also learned the game development fundamentals, 
from how to use SVGs graphics to even how to apply physics to make the ball move. It was a great learning experience.
